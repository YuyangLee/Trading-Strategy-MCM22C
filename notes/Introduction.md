### Introduction

Modern financial markets have a variety of volatile active assets, including gold and Bitcoin. Market traders often buy and sell these assets frequently, with a certain rate of commission in each transaction of course, in order to get the maximum return. With the increasing volatility of asset value and the increasing diversity of assets, it has become impossible to rely only on the personal experience of market traders. Therefore, a universal trading guidance model in the financial market is urgently needed. Using this model, people can predict the trend of the various assets over a period of time, and make the most reasonable decision to maximize the total return. 

On the other hand, various algorithms of machine learning, especially deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL, usually combined with deep learning, called DRL), have developed rapidly in recent years. From the success of these algorithms in extremely complex problems such as board games, it should also be appropriate to apply them to the prediction and decision-making of financial markets. In fact, there have been some research results in this field , and most of them have achieved good results. Based on these algorithms, after some optimization and a large number of experiments, this paper proposes a model that can accurately predict the price trend of gold and Bitcoin over a period of time, and give the trade strategy that can obtain the maximum return.
